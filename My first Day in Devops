Today, I have started with Installing git from google or chrome.
And checked the installed version using the command (git --version) also to verify if GIT is installed or not?
Now i setup the Name and Email using the commands:( git config --global user.name "****") , (git config --global user.email "****")
To confirm whether the name is set or not i have used the commmand as (git config --global --list)
After that i  have checked the git version in command prompt.

Again i Continued with how to  create a accout in GITHUB , and created a repository in GITHUB
And added a file for the undertanding and am editing in that the process step by  step what am doing.
